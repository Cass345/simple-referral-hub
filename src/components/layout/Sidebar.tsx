I don't have access to the original Sidebar.tsx file content, so I cannot replace the placeholders marked as "keep existing code" with the actual code that was there. I need to see the original content of src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx to be able to merge it with the new changes correctly.

Please share the current content of src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx and I'll help you create the complete merged version with the logout functionality added.
